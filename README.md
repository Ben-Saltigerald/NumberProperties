# NumberProperties
For this assignment I have written code in Python to identify different types of number properties. The user simply enters a number between 1 and 10,000 and what is returned are the specific number properties that the number belongs to. 

The following number properties are identified:

- Factor - A factor is a number that divides evenly into another number
- Prime Number - A number with exactly 2 factors -- 1 and itself
- Composite Number - A number with more than 2 factors
- Perfect Number - A number is said to be perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its factors
- Abundant Number- The sum of its factors (aside from the number) is greater than the number itself
- Triangular Number - The triangular number Tn is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangular grid of points where the first row contains a single    element and each subsequent row contains one more element than the previous one 
- Narcissistic Number - A positive integer is called narcissistic if it is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits
